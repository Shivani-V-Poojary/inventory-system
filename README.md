# Grocery shopping Inventory Management System
It is developed using python, MySQL, php(was used only to run python script) and html. No prerequites required to run the respective code. But just to import the sql file to store the data accordingly. 

If this project is deployed in any platform it is mandatory to include ProcFile(first page to be loaded when opening a web app), runtime.txt(contains version of python shell) and requirements.txt(contains libraries including its version).

If this project is made to execute in local machine then php files are not required just we need to change the path in each and every file from .php to .py. and replace the first line with these lines in python script :

#!path/to/pythonshell                                                                                                                                             print("Content-type: text/html\n")

We have merged all these changes, in the zip file, so it is not required to change anything. Above statements were just to make clear why php was used.
